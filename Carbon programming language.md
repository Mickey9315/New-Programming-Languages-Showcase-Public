# Carbon Programming language

# Description
Carbon is a statically typed, system programming language that has been devloped bye googlr that seeks to make improvement upon c++ by providing safer and more expressive syntax , better tools , and less maintainance. it is interoperable with c++ code , allowing coders to gradually adopt this new language within c++ projects.

# Devloped By
Carbon is devloped by google , by the contributions of a wider programming community. The language was introduces by <B>CHANDLER CARRUTH</B>, aprincipal software engineer at google , during 2022 CppNorth conference.

# Devloped In
Carbon is primarily devloped in the united states by engineers at Googl , though it is an ope-source, allowing contributions from devlopers worldwide.

# Breif History
Carbon was publically announced in july 2022 as an experimental language that could replace c++ in the coming future.The language was created in responce of the increasing complexity and challenges of maintainance of large c++ code bases.Google sought to devlop a language that can solve these issues and could also provide modern features and some more improvements. Well carbon is still in its early stages of devlopment, and its evolution and acceptance is ongoing, with the input of a very large programming community.

# USe Cases
1.System programming:  Carbon is intended for systems-level programming, where performance and low-level memory management are critical.

2.High Performance Applications: Like c++, Carbon is suitable for applications where performance is an important aspect, such as gaming engines, real-time systems, and scientific computing.

3.Interoperable with c++:Carbon can be used at the place of c++ while maintaining the existing c++ codebases.
