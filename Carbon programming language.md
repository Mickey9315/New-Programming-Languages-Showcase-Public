# Carbon (Programming Language)

### Description

Carbon is a statically typed systems programming language developed by Google, designed to improve upon C++ by offering a safer and more expressive syntax, enhanced tooling, and reduced maintenance burdens. It is interoperable with existing C++ code, allowing developers to gradually integrate Carbon into their C++ projects.

### Developed By

Carbon was introduced by Chandler Carruth, a principal software engineer at Google, during the 2022 CppNorth conference. The development of Carbon has been supported by contributions from a broader programming community, reflecting a collaborative effort to address the challenges faced in systems programming.

### Developed In

Primarily developed in the United States by engineers at Google, Carbon is an open-source project, enabling developers from around the world to contribute to its evolution.

### Brief History

Carbon was publicly announced in July 2022 as an experimental language aimed at addressing the complexities and maintenance challenges associated with large C++ codebases. The need for a modern programming language that could provide improved features and ease of use led to Carbon's creation. Although still in its early stages, Carbon has garnered attention and input from a large programming community, which continues to shape its development.

### Use Cases

- **Systems Programming**: Carbon is intended for systems-level programming, where performance and low-level memory management are essential.
- **High-Performance Applications**: Similar to C++, Carbon is suitable for applications requiring high performance, such as gaming engines, real-time systems, and scientific computing.
- **Interoperability with C++**: Carbon allows developers to replace C++ code incrementally while maintaining existing codebases, facilitating a smoother transition.

### Advantages

The advantages of Carbon include:
- **Improved Syntax and Safety**: Carbon offers a more expressive syntax that enhances code readability and safety.
- **Memory Safety**: The language incorporates features that promote memory safety, reducing the likelihood of common programming errors.
- **Tooling and Ecosystem**: Carbon benefits from a growing ecosystem of tools designed to enhance developer productivity.
- **Interoperability with C++**: The ability to work alongside existing C++ codebases allows for gradual adoption.

### Future Outlook

The future of Carbon hinges on its adoption by the C++ programming community. If it continues to evolve as planned, Carbon could emerge as a strong alternative to C++ for systems programming and high-performance applications. However, as it is still experimental, its widespread acceptance remains to be seen.
