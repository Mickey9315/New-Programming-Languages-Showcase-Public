# Roc (programming language)

### Description:

Roc is a functional, compile-to-binary programming language that introduces a new layer of abstraction into the technology stack. The language offers a statically typed system to simplify refactoring, build low-level applications and support embedded systems. It also offers some key capabilities associated with functional programming, such as isolation of code and separation of behavior and data.

### Developed by:

Roc was spearheaded by Richard Feldman, who made major contributions to Elm. Richard Feldman took on the task of creating Roc programming language for NoRedInk, working full-time on the project. The language already has 12,660 commits, bringing in experienced contributors to the project.

### Developed in:

The Roc programming language is still in development and not yet ready for a 0.1 release. ROC, short for Revolutionary Object-oriented C, has a fascinating history that traces back to its origins in the early 2000s. Spearheaded by a group of visionary developers, ROC aimed to bring a fresh perspective to the programming world. Over the years, it has undergone significant transformations, with key influencers shaping its trajectory.

### Sponsored by:

The Roc programming language is sponsored by the Roc Programming Language Foundation, a nonprofit charity that pays open-source contributors to develop Roc. Corporate sponsors of Roc include Vendr, RWX, Tweede golf, ohne-makler, and Decem. Additionally, individuals and organizations can donate to Roc's development through GitHub Sponsors and Liberapay, with all donations going through the Roc Programming Language Foundation.

### Brief History:

The Roc programming language is a functional, compile-to-binary language that was developed with the goal of creating a fast, friendly, and functional language for building fast and running fast. It was inspired by the Elm programming language, which has a fantastic language design. The Roc language was spearheaded by Richard Feldman, who made major contributions to its development.

### Advantages:

The Roc programming language has several advantages, including:
- **Ease of testing**: Roc allows developers to pull out different elements and test each function separately, making it easier to pinpoint problem areas and perfect one-off functionality.
- **Readability**: Roc is a functional coding language that many developers find aesthetically pleasing. Its straightforward syntax prioritizes readability and ease of use, making it accessible to beginners.
- **Performance**: Roc is generally faster than dynamic or gradual languages, and its programs should have almost strictly less runtime overhead than equivalent programs written in other languages. Benchmark testing has shown that Roc is as fast as C++ and faster than Go.
- **Safety**: Roc offers built-in protections to keep amateur programmers from making mistakes that could damage their computers. It is also a memory-safe language with automatic memory management, which reduces the risk of memory-related errors.
- **Versatility**: Roc's fusion of object-oriented programming and reactivity equips developers to work on diverse projects. It is targeted for use as a low-level language, making it suitable for backend applications.

Overall, Roc's simplicity, readability, performance, safety, and versatility make it a promising language for developers to consider.

### Use Cases:

- **Backend development**: Roc is targeted for use as a low-level language, making it suitable for backend applications.
- **Memory-safe programming**: Roc offers built-in protections to keep amateur programmers from making mistakes that could damage their computers. It is also a memory-safe language with automatic memory management, which reduces the risk of memory-related errors.
- **Performance**: Roc is generally faster than dynamic or gradual languages, and its programs should have almost strictly less runtime overhead than equivalent programs written in other languages.
- **Versatility**: Roc's fusion of object-oriented programming and reactivity equips developers to work on diverse projects.
- **Testing**: Roc allows developers to pull out different elements and test each function separately, making it easier to pinpoint problem areas and perfect one-off functionality.
- **Developing new languages**: Roc's creator, Richard Feldman, has mentioned that the development of programming languages in general has not kept up with the rapid pace of technology. Roc's design and features may help in the development of new languages that cater to the needs of modern software development.

As Roc continues to develop and gain traction, its use cases may expand and become more clearly defined.
